Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

I am happy to return the product; however, please note that the monitor was delivered to Spain (Madrid), and I am currently located here, not in Germany. Could you please let me know if there is a return address in Spain?

If a Spanish return address is not available, I can return the product to Germany. In that case, I would appreciate it if you could confirm the cost of the return shipping and provide details on how to make the payment.

I attach the receipt for the monitor purchase, which I received from Amazon. The order number is DS-AEU-INV-ES-2025-15362582.

I look forward to your instructions.

Best regards,

Sergio
